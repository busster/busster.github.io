title: JQuery / CSS Gears Rotator
---

This is just a fun little CSS and JQuery animation I made in my free time

What this does is just rotate your gears as if they were actually running when you hover over them!

## Images

First we're going to need some gears!
Here are the two png's I'll be using

!["Big Gear"](images/gears/big_gear.png)
!["Small Gear"](images/gears/small_gear.png)
