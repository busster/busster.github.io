Why Hello There! 

My name is Jason Buss, and I am a Web Developer from Chicago, IL. I graduated from the School of Architecture at University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign. I started coding doing visual scripting for 3d models in Grasshoper. This got me interested in coding, so I attended DevBootcamp in Chicago to learn Web Development, and have been in love with coding ever since!
